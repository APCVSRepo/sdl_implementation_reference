Rockchip IOMMU
==============

A Rockchip DRM iommu translates io virtual addresses to physical addresses for
its master device.  Each slave device is bound to a single master device, and
shares its clocks, power domain and irq.

Required properties:
- compatible      : Should be "rockchip,iommu"
- reg             : Address space for the configuration registers
- interrupts      : Interrupt specifier for the IOMMU instance
- interrupt-names : Interrupt name for the IOMMU instance
- clocks          : Iommu share clocks with master, to make map buffer success
                    when master disable clocks, iommu should control related
                    clocks itself
- clock-names     : Iommu related clock name, it should be "aclk" and "hclk" on
                    RK3399 SoC platform
- power-domains   : Iommu share power-domains with master, it have the same purpose
                    with the clocks
- #iommu-cells    : Should be <0>.  This indicates the iommu is a
                    "single-master" device, and needs no additional information
                    to associate with its master device.  See:
                    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/iommu.txt

Example:

	vopl_mmu: iommu@ff8f3f00 {
		compatible = "rockchip,iommu";
		reg = <0x0 0xff8f3f00 0x0 0x100>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 119 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH 0>;
		interrupt-names = "vopl_mmu";
		clocks = <&cru ACLK_VOP1>, <&cru HCLK_VOP1>;
		clock-names = "aclk", "hclk";
		power-domains = <&power RK3399_PD_VOPL>;
		#iommu-cells = <0>;
	};
