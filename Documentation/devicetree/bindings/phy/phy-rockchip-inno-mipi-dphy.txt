ROCKCHIP MIPI DPHY WITH INNO IP BLOCK

Required properties:
 - compatible : should be "rockchip,rk3368-mipi-dphy";
 - reg : the address offset of register for mipi-dphy configuration.
 - #phy-cells : must be 0. See ./phy-bindings.txt for details.
 - clocks and clock-names:
	- the "pclk" clock is required by the phy module, used to register
	  configuration
	- the "ref" clock is used to get the rate of the reference clock
	  provided to the PHY module
 - rockchip,dsi-panel : phandle to MIPI DSI panel node, used to get the display
			timing of the panel provided to the PHY module.

Optional properties
 - resets : phandle to the reset of MIPI DSI PHY APB clock.
 - reset-names : should be "apb".

Example:

For Rockchip RK3368

mipi_dphy: mipi-dphy@ff968000 {
	compatible = "rockchip,rk3368-mipi-dphy";
	reg = <0x0 0xff968000 0x0 0x4000>;
	#phy-cells = <0>;
	clocks = <&cru SCLK_MIPIDSI_24M>, <&cru PCLK_DPHYTX0>;
	clock-names = "ref", "pclk";
	resets = <&cru SRST_MIPIDPHYTX>;
	reset-names = "apb";
	rockchip,dsi-panel = <&dsi_panel>;
};

Then the PHY can be used in other nodes such as:

mipi-dsi-host@ff960000 {
	phys = <&mipi_dphy>;
	phy-names = "mipi_dphy";

	dsi_panel: panel {
		dsi,lanes = 4;
		...
	};
};
